# AI QuickFix README

AI QuickFix is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides quick fixes to code issues using Artificial Intelligence, powered by an open source model (CodeBERT).

# How to use

Write buggy code that VSCode, TypeScript, or a linter like SonarLint identifies as a problem. Click on the lightbulb that appears when you mouse over the problem, or click the Quick Fix button. Wait a few seconds while the extension attempts to fix your bug using CodeBERT.

## Features

The extension provides quick fixes to code issues using an open source AI model. Code issues are not discovered by this extension; it adds a fix command to issues found by VSCode, TypeScript, ESLint, and other linters like SonarLint.

When you ask it to fix a problem, it attempts to determine the surrounding function or context and passes this along with the detected issue to CodeBERT, which returns a fixed code snippet.

You can edit the prompts in the config settings—more information is below.

## Requirements

No proprietary API key is required; the extension leverages an open source AI model (CodeBERT).

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `aiquickfix.model`: Model to use for AI problem solving. Defaults to the open source "microsoft/CodeBERT".
- `aiquickfix.systemPrompt`: Initial instructions given to the AI.
- `aiquickfix.problemPrefix`: Text prepended to the linter's problem description.
- `aiquickfix.problemCodePrefix`: Text added before the code context.
- `aiquickfix.problemCodeSuffix`: Text added after the code context to format the AI's response.

The default settings work pretty well for me but I encourage you to prompt engineer and if you find a significantly better performing version open an issue and let me know!

## Continuous Background Code Fixer

This extension now includes a **Continuous Background Code Fixer** feature that automatically detects and attempts to fix code issues in the background.

### How to Enable

To enable the background fixer, add the following setting in your VSCode settings:

- `aiquickfix.backgroundFix.enabled`: Set this to `true` to enable automatic background fixing of code issues.

### Configuration Options

You can customize the background fixer with the following settings:

- `aiquickfix.backgroundFix.fileTypes`: An array of file types to monitor for automatic fixes. Default is `["javascript", "typescript", "python"]`.
- `aiquickfix.backgroundFix.rateLimit`: Minimum time (in milliseconds) between automatic fixes. Default is `1000` (1 second).
- `aiquickfix.backgroundFix.severityLevels`: An array of diagnostic severity levels to fix automatically. Default is `["error", "warning"]`.

### Known Issues

- GPT-3.5-turbo isn't great at following format instructions and may dump other messages or context into its response. GPT-4 is better about this.

## Tips

- If the answer might be ambigious, leave a comment explaining what you're trying to do, it will get sent to the AI too
- You can use CTRL-enter to preview a response
- I use this alongside [ChatGPT - Genie AI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=genieai.chatgpt-vscode) in my sidebar to give me full ChatGPT access when I need it. But it's nice to have an instant-fix button to avoid copy and paste for the simple issues.
- More linters give you more problems it can fix - I like SonarLint to find code smells as well, even if they're not technically problems it's nice to avoid them.
